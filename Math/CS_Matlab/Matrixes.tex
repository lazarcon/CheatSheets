  $m^{-1}$ & Creates the inverse of a matrix\\
  \texttt{eye}& Basic Matrix (all diagonal values are 1)\\

Matrixes allow the following operations: \texttt{+, -, *, /, \^}.
To invoke an operation on the elements contained, the operator must have \texttt{.} before it.

The operator \texttt{:} means from left (including) to right (including).
A step size operator may be included in between: \texttt{1:2:10} means the values 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.
